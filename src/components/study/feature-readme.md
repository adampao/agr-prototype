# AGR Philosopher Switching Feature

## Overview

This feature enhances the AGR platform by adding dynamic philosopher recommendations based on conversation context. When a user's questions move beyond a philosopher's area of expertise, the system intelligently suggests switching to a more knowledgeable philosophical guide.

## Key Components

### 1. Philosopher Switch Component
A UI component that appears when the system detects that another philosopher may be better suited to address the current line of inquiry.

### 2. Philosopher Expertise Mapping
A comprehensive knowledge graph defining each philosopher's areas of expertise and the relationships between philosophical domains.

### 3. Topic Detection Service
Analyzes conversation context to identify when topics shift outside a philosopher's primary expertise.

### 4. Enhanced Chat Interface
Integrates the switching mechanism into the existing chat experience with smooth transitions.

## How It Works

1. **Conversation Analysis**: The system continuously monitors the conversation for topics that might be better addressed by a different philosopher.

2. **Contextual Suggestion**: When a topic shift is detected, the system suggests an appropriate philosopher with relevant expertise.

3. **Seamless Transition**: If the user accepts, the conversation continues with the new philosopher who is better equipped to address the current inquiry.

4. **Knowledge Continuity**: The new philosopher acknowledges the context of the previous conversation while bringing their unique perspective.

## Technical Implementation

- **React Components**: Modular design for easy integration
- **Context Analysis**: Uses keyword matching and conversational context
- **Anthropic API Integration**: Custom prompting based on philosopher expertise
- **Branding Consistency**: Maintains AGR's visual identity throughout the experience

## User Experience Benefits

- **Deeper Expertise**: Users receive insights from the most knowledgeable philosopher on any given topic
- **Educational Value**: Exposes users to the interconnected nature of philosophical inquiry
- **Engaging Interactions**: Creates a more dynamic conversation that mirrors how real philosophical discourse would evolve
- **Personalized Journey**: Adapts to the user's interests and inquiry patterns

## Future Enhancements

- Enhanced NLP for more sophisticated topic detection
- Multi-philosopher roundtable discussions on complex topics
- Personalized philosopher recommendations based on user's philosophical alignment
- Visual transitions to represent the shift between philosophical schools
